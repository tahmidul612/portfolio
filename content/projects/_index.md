I am currently studying Computer Science at Lakehead University, and hoping to graduate in April 2024. My laziness compels me to learn more about automation so that I can do less work. So my current field of interest is automation.

## Personal Projects

### Media Server

I use a Ubuntu Server to store and host my Anime collection, using multiple softwares to make the process automated. Github and Docker are a major part of my entire system. I store my docker compose files in Github and deploy my containers to multiple nodes in a Docker swarm through Portainer.

### Game Server

One of my best buddies lives in a different city, and we wanted to play games together. Since NVIDIA GPUs recently unlocked GPU-P support, I decided that was a great opportunity for me to learn more and let my friend play games.
I used Hyper-V in Windows to setup a guest Windows system and shared my GPU partition with it. My friend can now remotely access the guest system with Parsec and play games, while I have full access to my PC.
